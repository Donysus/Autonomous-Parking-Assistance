# Autonomous Parking Assistance System

This project implements an optimized A* path planning algorithm for an autonomous parking system. The system simulates a parking lot grid with obstacles, calculates the optimal path from an entrance to a designated parking spot, and visualizes the computed route.

## Features

- **8â€‘Directional Movement:** Supports diagonal moves with proper obstacle checks.
- **Optimized A\* Algorithm:** Utilizes an octile distance heuristic for accurate pathfinding.
- **Realistic Parking Layout:** Configurable grid with barriers, VIP zones, and dedicated entrance.
- **Visualization:** Interactive visual display using Matplotlib.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python autonomous_parking.py
```

## Files

1. autonomous_parking.py - Main project code.
